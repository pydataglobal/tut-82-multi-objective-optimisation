### Main Take Aways From Hands The On Sessions

The notebooks will help you learn to solve for multiple objective optimisation problems and visualise results.


* In `01_knapsack 2D_exhaustive.ipynb` you will optimise for the knapsack problem in an exhaustive solution space. Here you will learn:
    * The limitations of the commonly practiced Single Objective Optimisation.  
    * Pareto Fronts: identifying by eye Pareto optimal solutions within a distribution as well as pseudocode for selecting these *Non-Dominated* solutions.
    * Optimisation concepts *Decision Spaces* and *Objective Spaces*. These concepts are useful to determine the applicability of Pareto Optimisation.
* In `02_knapsack_2D_stochastic.ipynb` you optimise for the knapsack problem in an intractable search space. Here you will learn:
    * Stochasticity and Pareto front approximations 
    * Genetic Algorithm basics with an emphasis on Pareto fronts as the selection function.   
    * To track the learning progress of a Genetic Algorithm by means of the evolution of Pareto front approximations.
    * Improving population diversity by niching.

## TL;DR
Optimising for multiple objectives is a non-trivial task, especially when they are in conflict. For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined?  In this hands-on Python tutorial you will learn about Pareto Fronts and use them to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously.

This hands-on tutorial is geared towards anyone interested in improving their optimisation skills (e.g, analysts, scientists, engineers, economists), in which you will learn and implement

The only requirements are basic usage of `numpy` and `matplotlib`. The maths required is highschool level. 

Here you will find Jupyter notebooks with which you will apply lessons and tools learned to the simple [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). 
You will program for filling a bag with packages with the objective of minimising the bag weight while maximising its content value.

## Motivation
Multi-Objective Optimisation, also known as Pareto Optimisation, is a method to optimise for multiple parameters simultaneously. When applicable, this method provides better results than the common practice of combining multiple parameters into a single parameter heuristic. The reason for this is quite simple. The single heuristic approach is like horse binders limiting the view of the solution space, whereas Pareto Optimisation enables a birdâ€™s eye view

Real world applications span from supply chain management, manufacturing, aircraft design to land use planning. For example when developing therapeutics, Pareto optimisation may help a biologist maximise protein properties like effectiveness and manufacturability while simultaneously minimising toxicity.

This hands-on tutorial is geared towards anyone interested in improving their optimisation skills (e.g, analysts, scientists, engineers, economists), in which you will learn and implement:

*  The limitations of the common practice of combining multiple parameters into one heuristic.
*  *Pareto Fronts*: the notion in which there may be a set of trade-off solutions which are considered equally optimal.   
* Application of the Pareto Front method to Evolutionary Algorithms to find optimal solutions in an intractable search space.
* Applicability in the real world

We will use Python and work in a Jupyter notebook environment.
